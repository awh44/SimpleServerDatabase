SimpleServerDatabase
====================

An implementation of a crappy, simple database with SQL-like operations. (Though not actually relational.) It stores its "databases" files that are strange mixture of straight XML and flat-file. While the user is using the program, he has an active database which is read from a file and completely stored in memory while it remains active.
